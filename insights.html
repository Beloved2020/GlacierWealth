          <p class="introText">Investing is not for everyone. The risks are high and, more than ever, it’s imperative to partner with an advisory firm—like GlacierWealth—that’s built a reputation on personal commitment to client objectives.</p>
          <p class="introText">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="introText">We'd like to share some insight into the  murky side of Wall Street that clients hear about but so often don't have time to research further. We recommend  reading the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Are-Customers-Yachts-Investment/dp/0471770892"><em>Where are the Customers' Yachts?</em></a> by Fred Schwed Jr. This classic provides humorous insight into the inner workings of conventional Wall Street. Written in 1940, much of the text still rings true today.</li>
            <li> <a href="http://www.crestmontresearch.com" target="_blank">Crestmont Research</a>. This website offers free information and observations about financial markets   based on actual data, not spin. According to the site, its research is intended to be &quot;observation-based rather than prediction-oriented. It intends to provide information and perspectives to assist in rational decisions.&quot; We think its findings are right on the mark.</li>
            <li><a href="docs/Long-TermStockMarketReturns.pdf" target="_blank">Stock Market from 1900-2012</a>, a look at long-term investing by Crestmont Research. You'll see that there are several time periods, decades or more in some cases, during which an investor would have simply lost money.  So, what does it mean that long-term investing&#8212;what we've been taught to regard as the &quot;safest&quot; bet&#8212;can be risky? It means that ALL investing is risky, and that there are no right answers or perfect formulas.</li>
            <li><a href="docs/2012QAIB.pdf" target="_blank">DALBAR's <em>2012 Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior (QAIB)</em> study</a> is in its 18th year of documenting a troubling fact: investors lack the consistent ability to make prudent, profitable decisions for themselves.  Here's a direct quote from the DALBAR website: &quot;Since 1994, DALBAR's QAIB has been measuring the effects of investor decisions to buy, sell and switch into and out of mutual funds over both short- and long-term time frames. The results consistently show that the average investor earns less&#8212;in many cases, much less&#8212;than mutual fund performance reports would suggest...Investment results are more dependent on investor behavior than on fund performance. Mutual fund investors who hold on to their investments are more successful than those who time the market.&quot;  </li>
                       
            </ul>
             <p class="introText">&nbsp;</p>             
             <p class="introText">Does all this want to make you hide your money under your mattress? We don't blame you. That's why it's critical to work with an investment firm that  can help you demystify the market. GlacierWealth believes the more you know, the better decisions we can make together.
